# C++ Project Boilerplate

Opionated boilerplate project skeleton for C++ projects with CMake and GoogleTest.

## Key points

- Include with `#include "project/path/to/header.h"` (full path)
- Unit testing with Google Test
- Test files among source files and not in a distinct test directory
  - For example, `file.cpp` and `file_test.cpp` would go to `project` directory
